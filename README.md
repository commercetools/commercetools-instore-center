[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/commercetools/commercetools-instore-center.svg?token=G3zYkVxzDwVADM6vtKUL&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/commercetools/commercetools-instore-center)

## Synopsis

The Commercetools in store app allows customers to manage order reservations from the Sunrise mobile app, reviewing customer insights and checking inventory entries for different channels.

## Motivation

The motivation of this app is to allow sales force to engage customers and improving the shopping experience by using the information already existing in the Commercetools platform and machine learning features. and machine learning features.

Its current incarnation targets the staff of a physical store that is part of a 'click and collect' fulfilment offering. 

## Installation

Install local dependencies of the implementation:
```
npm install
```

In addition you need a commercetools platform project with suitable data structures:
 * There need to be channels set up that have the ```ProductDistribution``` and the ```InventorySupply``` roles set. 
 * The in-store UI only shows orders that have 
   1. a custom Boolean field ```isReservation``` set.
   2. the correct store set as the ```supplyChannel``` of the order line items to be picked up. 

This is the type of data generated by the SUNRISE demo storefront, so you can use the [SUNRISE example data](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sunrise-data)  and the [SUNRISE Java Storefront](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sunrise-java-starter) to set up the data and a storefront to easily create the reservation orders. 

## Launch and Configuration

Configuration files for the commercetools API and client credentials can be found in the [src/config/env/](src/config/env/) folder. 
They override the data in ```default.json```.  API defaults to the EU CTP at ```api.sphere.io```.
 
You need to set your project's credentials there.  
The best way is to create a specific client ID for this app. 

<!--

XXX THERE ARE DYSFUNCITONAL ARTIFACTS FOR THIS IN THE CODE:

The ```development``` environment can be configured ad-hoc with the following environment variables:
 * ```CTP_PROJECT_KEY```
 * ```CTP_CLIENT_IDY```
 * ```CTP_CLIENT_SECRET```
-->

The 'default' build command launches a local server with the ```development``` configuration:
```
npm run-script gulp
```

The production configuration can be launched as:
```
npm run-script production
```

The local address of both is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
